### 5NG#2: Linegraphs

Linegraphs show the **relationship** between 2 **numerical** variables.

The explanatory (x-axis) variable **must be of** sequential ordering.

**Linegraph syntax in R:**

```{r linegraph}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data= my_data, mapping = aes(x = var1, y = var2)) +
  geom_line()

```

***

### 5NG#2: Linegraphs

When describing linegraphs...

-   Look for pattern going from left to right.
-   Classify association as positive, negative, or no association.
-   Classify relationship as linear or non linear.
-   Check x and y scales to make sure they are appropriate.

***

### 5NG#3: Histograms

-   Histograms are used to visualize the **distribution** of a single **numerical** variable.

-   Histograms display **numerical** data by grouping data into bins of equal width.

-   There is **no** 'y' position aesthetic for `geom_histogram()` because we are investigating a single variable.

***

### 5NG#3: Histograms

**Histogram syntax in R:**

```{r histogram}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data= my_data, aes(x = var1)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue", bins = 10)

```

<br>

There are 3 things we look and describe when inspecting a histogram:

-   shape (skew and modality)
-   center (mean or median)
-   spread (range, IQR, or standard deviation)

Not all distributions have a simple recognizable shape!

Teaching tip: open up the shiny app so student's can see how the bins change as you move the slider.

Which bin is best?

-   18 bins
-   emphasize that there is a broad range of bin sizes that would work well. You want to make sure you can see the shape but not every little up and down.

Describe the districution? - center around 3750 - spread in terms of range is \~2500 to 6500 - right skewed and "fairly" unimodal (could argue there is a small peak around 4750 and 5250)

### Example 1: Histogram bins

Which bin size is most appropriate and describe the distribution of penguin body mass.

::: panel-tabset
## Bins = 7

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=penguins$body_mass_g)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                   fill = "lightblue", 
                   bins = 7)+
    labs(title = "Palmer Penguins Distribution of Body Mass",
           x = "Body Mass (g)")
```

## Bins = 18

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=penguins$body_mass_g)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                   fill = "lightblue", 
                   bins = 18)+
    labs(title = "Palmer Penguins Distribution of Body Mass",
           x = "Body Mass (g)")
```

## Bins = 29

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=penguins$body_mass_g)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                   fill = "lightblue", 
                   bins = 29)+
    labs(title = "Palmer Penguins Distribution of Body Mass",
           x = "Body Mass (g)")

### Example 2: Histogram bins

Which bin size is most appropriate and describe the distribution of penguin flipper length.

::: panel-tabset
## Bins = 15

```{r}

  ggplot(penguins, aes(x=penguins$flipper_length_mm )) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                   fill = "tomato1", 
                   bins = 15)+
    labs(title = "Palmer Penguins Distribution of Flipper Length",
           x = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

## Bins = 25

```{r}

  ggplot(penguins, aes(x=penguins$flipper_length_mm )) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                   fill = "tomato1", 
                   bins = 25)+
    labs(title = "Palmer Penguins Distribution of Flipper Length",
           x = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

## Bins = 35

```{r}

  ggplot(penguins, aes(x=penguins$flipper_length_mm )) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                   fill = "tomato1", 
                   bins = 35)+
    labs(title = "Palmer Penguins Distribution of Flipper Length",
           x = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```

### Faceting

-   Faceting is used to make the same plot for different subgroups of the dataset.

-   This is useful for comparing the same variable across different subgroups in the dataset.

-   `facet_wrap(~var)` can be added on to ANY plot type (scatterplot, linegraph, histogram, boxplot, barplot)

<br>

```{r faceting}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "tomato1", bins = 11) +
    facet_wrap(~ species)
```

***

:::{.callout-important appearance="minimal"}

::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.90\\textwidth}"}
Which is correct?

-   b and d
-   aes() is for variables! Since "white" is not a variable it does not go in the aes().

### Common Coding Errors {.scrollable}

Which of the following are correct?

    a)  

```{r}

ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(color = "white"))
```

    b)  

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")
```

    c)  

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_histogram(x = flipper_length_mm, color = "white")
```

    d)  

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = flipper_length_mm) , color = "white")
```

### Extra information and resources {.scrollable .smaller}

[Wikipedia bin size info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width)

Helpful guidelines:

-   Larger number of observations generally correspond to larger number of bins needed.

-   You will generally need to test **several** different number of bins to learn about the data and find an appropriate value.

-   Sturges Rule of Thumb for unimodal symmetric distributions: bins = 1 + 3.322\*log(n)

-   Sturge's rule is not great if the data is severely skewed, multi-modal, or for an extremely large number of observations. But it could give you a starting place and then you will want to increase the number of bins until you can properly see the shape.
