A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. A typical class will devote 10-15 minutes to discussion/lecture with the remainder of the class devoted to working on activities where students will either work by themselves or in groups. Throughout the class we will discuss and review the work on the activities. In many cases we may come together to work on parts of an activity as a class."

Students will be allowed one 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet (front & back) on the in-class exams.\n\n\nFinal Project\nThe projects will focus on practical application of course material. More information about the project will be provided during the quarter.\n\n\nExam Improvement Policy\nWe have worked to develop a policy geared towards a growth mindset. That is, we want a policy where students clearly demonstrate that they have used the midterm as a diagnostic tool to learn from and improve their understanding of statistics. Since the final is cumulative we have settled on a policy where we will replace your in-class midterm score with your in-class final score — only in cases where it is an improvement"
