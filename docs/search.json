A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. A typical class will devote 10-15 minutes to discussion/lecture with the remainder of the class devoted to working on activities where students will either work by themselves or in groups. Throughout the class we will discuss and review the work on the activities. In many cases we may come together to work on parts of an activity as a class."

Students will be allowed one 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet (front & back) on the in-class exams.\n\n\nFinal Project\nThe projects will focus on practical application of course material. More information about the project will be provided during the quarter.\n\n\nExam Improvement Policy\nWe have worked to develop a policy geared towards a growth mindset. That is, we want a policy where students clearly demonstrate that they have used the midterm as a diagnostic tool to learn from and improve their understanding of statistics. Since the final is cumulative we have settled on a policy where we will replace your in-class midterm score with your in-class final score — only in cases where it is an improvement"

To learn more about Quarto see https://quarto.org.\n\nTask 6  message: false is ‘Challenge’\n\n\n\nLoading Package\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-pkgs\n#| message: false\nlibrary(nycflights13)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n\n\nRunning Code\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:\n\n```{r}\n\n1 + 1\n```\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nThe echo: false option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n\n\nTasks\nComplete the following series of tasks. Remember to render early and render often.\n\nTask 1\nIt will be easier for you to compare your qmd file to the html file if we make a slight change to the RStudio settings.\n\nFind the gear/sprocket icon next to the Render button.\nClick it and then select Preview in Viewer Pane.\nRender the document to see the change.\n\nNow take some time to compare what you see in this document with the html version that is now previewed in the viewer pane.\n\n\nTask 2\nLet’s make some adjustments to the document:\n\nChange the title to “R Markdown Practice”.\nAdd an “Activity 01” as a subtitle. Hint subtitle: goes right below title:.\nChange the author to your name.\nChange the date to today’s date in “YYYY-MM-DD” format. Example 9/1/2030 becomes 2030-09-01.\n\n\n\nTask 3\nInsert an R code chunk BELOW and name it task3. Place the following two lines of code in it:\n\nTask 3\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: task3\nx <- 9\ny <- 45\n```\n\n\nThe <- is an assignment operator. Here it assigned the number 9 to x and the number 45 to y. You store values so that you can access them by name later!\n\n\nTask 4\nChange the R code chunk options below to eval=true or alternatively you can simply remove #| eval=false from the code chunk options. Either will have the same effect. This depends on completing Task 3 correctly.\n\neval: false -> eval: true\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: task 4\n#| eval: true\nx * y\n```\n\n[1] 405\n\n\n\n\nTask 5\nLet’s focus on R code chunks. You may have noticed a down arrow and a green arrow on the upper right side of the code chunk.\nClick the green arrow on the task4 R code chunk.\nAn error MIGHT pop up right below the R chunk (if you did not get an error that is OKAY - you are one step ahead of us).\nBefore we address the potential error let’s change an RStudio setting. Again, find the gear/sprocket next to the Knit button. Click it and select Chunk Output in Console. A pop-up should appear, select remove output. Now click the green arrow on the task4 R code chunk. Any ouput or message should now appear in the console below.\nNow let’s take care of the error. Note that the error doesn’t appear when you knit the document. All the code works fine. Test this out if you haven’t already. This seems a little strange?\nIt comes down to what happens when you click Render. A brand new session of R is started in the background (you don’t see this), it produces the document, and then closes down.\nWhen we click the green arrow on the task4 R code chunk we are not knitting. We are running code in our current R session. If you never ran the task3 code chunk in our current R session the required variables do not exist yet and cannot be used. So we just need to run the task3 code chunk before running the task4 chunk.\nStop for a second and imagine if the task4 chunk depended on several code chunks. We can run all previous code chunks by clicking the icon with a down arrow and a green bar — do this for the task4 R code chunk. If you check your environment pane (top-right), then you will see the needed pieces have been created. Now click the green arrow on the task4 chunk and it should return 405 in the console.\n\n\nTask 6\nPlace a new section right before the Running Code with the header Loading Packages. Create an R code chunk named load-pkgs in the section and use it to load nycflights13, dplyr and knitr.\nNow alter the R code chunk below to get it to evaluate/run.\n\neval: false -> eval: true\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: kable-test\n#| eval: true\n#| message: false\n\nairlines\nkable(airlines)\n```\n\n# A tibble: 16 x 2\n   carrier name                       \n   <chr>   <chr>                      \n 1 9E      Endeavor Air Inc.          \n 2 AA      American Airlines Inc.     \n 3 AS      Alaska Airlines Inc.       \n 4 B6      JetBlue Airways            \n 5 DL      Delta Air Lines Inc.       \n 6 EV      ExpressJet Airlines Inc.   \n 7 F9      Frontier Airlines Inc.     \n 8 FL      AirTran Airways Corporation\n 9 HA      Hawaiian Airlines Inc.     \n10 MQ      Envoy Air                  \n11 OO      SkyWest Airlines Inc.      \n12 UA      United Air Lines Inc.      \n13 US      US Airways Inc.            \n14 VX      Virgin America             \n15 WN      Southwest Airlines Co.     \n16 YV      Mesa Airlines Inc.         \n\n\n\n\n\ncarrier\nname\n\n\n\n\n9E\nEndeavor Air Inc.\n\n\nAA\nAmerican Airlines Inc.\n\n\nAS\nAlaska Airlines Inc.\n\n\nB6\nJetBlue Airways\n\n\nDL\nDelta Air Lines Inc.\n\n\nEV\nExpressJet Airlines Inc.\n\n\nF9\nFrontier Airlines Inc.\n\n\nFL\nAirTran Airways Corporation\n\n\nHA\nHawaiian Airlines Inc.\n\n\nMQ\nEnvoy Air\n\n\nOO\nSkyWest Airlines Inc.\n\n\nUA\nUnited Air Lines Inc.\n\n\nUS\nUS Airways Inc.\n\n\nVX\nVirgin America\n\n\nWN\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\n\n\nYV\nMesa Airlines Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional challenge (don’t have to complete)\nAlter the R code chunk options for load-pkgs to suppress the messages from appearing.\n\n\nTask 7\nExport your completed document and submit the activity on Canvas.\n\nBe sure you always render the final document before you export.\nIt will create a document in the Files pane called Last_First_act_01.html.

If a passenger survived, then the variable Survived = 1.\n\n```{r}\n\ntitanic %>% \n  select(PassengerId, Survived, Sex) %>%\n  glimpse()\n```\n\nRows: 418\nColumns: 3\n$ PassengerId <dbl> 892, 893, 894, 895, 896, 897, 898, 899, 900, 901, 902, 903~\n$ Survived    <dbl> 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1~\n$ Sex         <chr> \"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"femal~\n\n\nIs Survived a categorical or numerical variable?\nR will read in numerical columns as “numbers” even though these numbers are supposed to represent “categories”.\nTo fix this we need to use the factor() function.\nTyping factor(Survived) would turn the variable into a “factor”.\n\n\n5NG#5: Barplots\nA barplot is used to visualize the distribution (frequencies) of a single categorical variable.\n\ngeom_bar() is used when we have the raw data and counting how many observations are in each category has to be done (list not yet counted).\ngeom_col() is used when we directly have counts of each category in our dataset (pre-counted).\n\nBarplot syntax in R:\n\nggplot(data= my_data, aes(x = var1)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n5NG#5: Barplots continued\nWhen describing a barplot we look for…\n\nDisparities in the height of the bars.\nBar with the most observations.\nBar with the least observations.\nIf all the bars are about equal height, then the distribution is uniform.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we using geom_bar() or geom_col()?\n\ngeom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Barplots\nConsider the Palmer Penguins dataset.\n\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nhead(penguins)\n```\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_l~1 body_~2 sex    year\n  <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>       <int>   <int> <fct> <int>\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7         181    3750 male   2007\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4         186    3800 fema~  2007\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18           195    3250 fema~  2007\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA            NA      NA <NA>   2007\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3         193    3450 fema~  2007\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6         190    3650 male   2007\n# ... with abbreviated variable names 1: flipper_length_mm, 2: body_mass_g\n\n\nWe are interested in plotting the distribution of species.\nAre we using geom_bar() or geom_col()?\n\nWhat would pre-counted data look like?\n\nDataCode\n\n\n\n```{r}\n\npenguins_counted\n```\n\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\n  species       n\n  <fct>     <int>\n1 Adelie      152\n2 Chinstrap    68\n3 Gentoo      124\n\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n\npenguins_counted <- penguins %>% \n  count(species)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching note:\n\nstacked: best if you are interested in overall counts but difficult to visually see if there is a difference between categories because of the different counts\nproportion: best if you are interested in the rate within each category. Not concerned with counts.\nside-by-side: best if you want to see differences between categories but still want to see the count discrepancies between the main category\n\n\n\nExample 2: Barplots\nWhat if we want to visualize the distribution of sex in each of the species. There are 4 main ways to visualize multiple levels within a categorical data:\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  ylab(\"proportion\")\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=penguins, aes(x = species))+\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra information and resources\n“factor” vs “character” variable\n\nfactor has predefined levels and the observation must be one of those levels (limited response options).\ncharacter can take on any string value (think open response options)\nFactors in R"
