## Today's tasks

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Teaching note:

I recommend using Posit Cloud if possible for ease of getting started. Otherwise you will need to dedicate more time towards downloading R and RStudio. 

See the sample survey for some examples of questions to ask your students! We use these survey results on the exams.

Make sure you have completed the following agenda items by the end of class!

1.  Review the syllabus
2.  Visit the course's [Campuswire page](https://campuswire.com) using your school email. Enrollment code: XXXX
3.  Gain access to the Posit Cloud Class Workspace or install R and RStudio
4.  We will be using [AHA slides](https://ahaslides.com) for participation.
5.  Set up and test out the Reading Tutorials System. 
  Install the required package: `remotes::install_github("NUstat/isdsTutorials", dependencies = TRUE`
  Try running the first tutorial: `learnr::run_tutorial("01_intro", package = "isdsTutorials")`
6.  Login/create your [Northwestern Zoom Account](https://northwestern.zoom.us/) if you do not have one. This will be used for office hours or requested appointments.
